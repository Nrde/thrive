// Monica, I have turned your side-by-side comments into above-line comments.
// As you can see, this greatly aids cross-dev communication, addendums, and
// the ability to read on smaller screens.
// 
// PROTIP: You should also consider post-fixing your comments with your 
// name and timestamp. It greatly helps future onlookers.
//
// You should always be pro enough to stand by any code you wrote.  I leave 
// my email in the code and fix any horrible code someone finds for free, 
// even years later.  Of course, I've never been notified of my code being
// horrible, but there's a first for everything ;p 
//
// This is *particularly* important whenever you fix bugs. You generally
// should leave a note on what was wrong that you fixed. I dont do this 
// much on my own code cuz 1) it's usually not buggy and 2) I work alone.
// At work, I leave the comments religiously. -Ted 2011-03-21
